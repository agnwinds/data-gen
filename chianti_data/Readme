Python scripts in this directory are designed to strip out relevant data from the Chianti database
They expect to be placed at the same level in the directory structure as the Chianti directory

chainti_rr_dr_to_py.py simply takes all dielectrconic recombination rates and radiative recombinationbs rates
and puts them in files called chianti_dr.dat and chianti_rr.dat with appropriate headers and keywords
to allow read_atomic data to read them in.

coll_stren_lookup.py requires the list of lines to be in the same directory (lines_linked_ver_2.dat)
It searches the chianti database .scups files for matches, and puts those matching collision
strength lines in a file called ver_upsilon_linked.dat.

History:

240125 - ksl - I have updated the two python scripts so that they are python3 compatiable and run with the current version of the Chianti database.  I have not changed the functionality (I hope)
