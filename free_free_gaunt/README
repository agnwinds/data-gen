The data in this directory is for the free-free gaunt factors from Sutherland 1997. The three data files downloaded directly from the website http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ralph/data/freefree/ are:


gffew.dat.txt
gffgu.dat.txt
gffint.dat.txt

with the last one being the one we currently use. The translation to python friendly format is simply the commenting out of comment lines with a hash symbol, and the insertion of the label FF_GAUNT at the start of each data line. The python friendly data file is 

gffint.dat
